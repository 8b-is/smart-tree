Smart Tree is a blazingly fast, AI-friendly directory visualization tool that makes the traditional `tree` command look like it's stuck in the stone age. Written in Rust for speed demons and optimized for both human eyeballs and AI tokens.

## 🎸 What Makes Smart Tree Rock?

- **10-100x faster** than traditional tree (because waiting is for chumps)
- **30+ output formats** including quantum compression (yes, quantum!)
- **AI-optimized modes** with 10x token reduction
- **MCP server built-in** for Claude Desktop integration
- **Smart edit tools** with 90% token reduction for code editing
- **Real-time file watching** with SSE support
- **Git-aware** with temporal analysis
- **Memory-efficient** streaming for millions of files

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install from source (the fun way)
git clone https://github.com/8b-is/smart-tree.git
cd smart-tree
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/st /usr/local/bin/

# Or use the manage script (the Aye way)
./scripts/manage.sh install

# Basic usage
st                           # Classic tree view
st --mode quantum            # 8x compression with MEM|8
st --mode summary-ai         # 10x compression for AI
st --search "TODO"           # Find all TODOs
st --mode mermaid mindmap    # Generate diagrams
```

## 🎨 Output Modes Galore

### For Humans
- `classic` - Traditional tree with Unicode box drawing
- `ls` - Simple one-line-per-file format
- `stats` - Directory statistics and analysis
- `mermaid` - Flowcharts, mindmaps, and treemaps

### For AI
- `ai` - Optimized format with embedded stats
- `summary-ai` - Maximum compression (10x reduction)
- `quantum` - Ultra-compressed binary format (100x)
- `quantum-semantic` - Semantic-aware compression

### For Data Scientists
- `json`, `csv`, `tsv` - Standard data formats
- `hex` - Fixed-width hexadecimal
- `digest` - SHA256 directory fingerprints

## 🤖 MCP Integration (Claude Desktop)

```bash
# Add to Claude Desktop config
st --mcp-config

# Or manually add to ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smart-tree": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/st",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Tools Available
- `quick_tree` - Lightning-fast 3-level overview
- `project_overview` - Comprehensive project analysis  
- `find_code_files` - Locate source files by language
- `search_in_files` - Content search across codebases
- `smart_edit` - AST-aware code editing (90% token savings!)
- And 25+ more tools!

## 📊 Real-World Performance

```bash
# Home directory with 2.4M files
time tree ~ > /dev/null       # 4.8 seconds
time st ~ > /dev/null          # 0.23 seconds (20x faster!)

# Large codebase (100k files)
st --mode summary-ai           # 10KB output (was 1MB)
st --mode quantum              # 1KB output (was 1MB)
```

## 🎬 Advanced Features

### SSE Server (Real-time Monitoring)
```bash
st --sse-server --sse-port 8420 /path/to/watch
# Now stream changes: curl -N http://localhost:8420/sse
```

### File History Tracking
```bash
# Track all AI file operations
st --track-operations
# View history: ls ~/.mem8/.filehistory/
```

### Smart Edit (Token-Efficient Editing)
```bash
# Use with MCP for 90% token reduction
mcp.callTool('smart_edit', {
  file_path: 'app.rs',
  edits: [{
    operation: 'InsertFunction',
    name: 'process_data',
    body: 'fn process_data() { ... }'
  }]
})
```
