**"Making directories beautiful, one tree at a time!"** - *Trish from Accounting (our #1 fan!)*

## 🎉 What the Heck is Smart Tree?

Remember the old `tree` command? Well, we gave it a PhD, taught it to dance, and introduced it to AI! Smart Tree is the **world's first AI-native directory visualizer** that actually understands what modern developers (and their AI assistants) need.

### 🏆 The *"Holy Smokes!"* Numbers 🏆

| Metric | Old Way | Smart Tree Way | Your Reaction |
|:------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| **Directory Size** | 487 MB | 4.1 MB | 😱 "Wait, what?!" |
| **AI Token Cost** | $1,270 | ~$10 | 💰 "I'm rich!" |
| **Processing Speed** | 🐌 Slow | ⚡ 10-24x faster | 🚀 "Wheee!" |
| **Compression** | None | 99% | 🤯 "How?!" |
| **Fun Factor** | 0% | 100% | 🎉 "Finally!" |

## 🌟 Version 3.1.1: "Less is More" Edition! 

### 🎸 What's NEW (or should we say... what's GONE?)

**BREAKING NEWS**: Elvis has left the building! 🚪

- **❌ Removed Interactive Mode** - Because sometimes, simplicity rocks harder than complexity!
- **✅ Classic Mode is DEFAULT** - Just run `st` and boom! Beautiful trees! 
- **🚀 Smaller, Faster, Better** - Like a sports car that lost weight and gained speed!
- **💾 One Less Dependency** - `inquire` said goodbye, and we're not crying!

## 🚀 Quick Start (Faster than Making Coffee ☕)

### 🐧 Linux/Mac/WSL - The One-Liner Wonder!

```bash
# This magical incantation will change your life:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8b-is/smart-tree/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# That's it. You're done. Go visualize some directories! 🎊
```

### 🌈 The Basics - Simple Yet Powerful

```bash
# The classics never die! (Now the default in v3.1.1!)
st                          # Current directory with beautiful trees 🌳
st /path/to/directory       # Specific directory - point and shoot! 🎯

# Quick exploration
st --depth 2                # Shallow dive - just the tip of the iceberg 🧊
st --everything             # SHOW ME EVERYTHING! (Even the scary parts) 👀
st -a                       # Include hidden files (they're shy) 🙈
```

### 🎨 Output Modes - Pick Your Flavor!

<details>

st -m relations             # 🔗 Code relationship analysis
```

</details>

### 🔍 Finding Stuff - Like a Detective!

```bash
# Find files like a boss
st --find "*.rs"            # 🦀 Rust files, assemble!
st --find "TODO"            # 📝 Find all your broken promises
st --type py                # 🐍 Python files only
st --search "FIXME"         # 🔍 Search inside files (X-ray vision!)

# Size matters
st --min-size 10M           # 🐘 Find the chonky files
st --max-size 1K            # 🐜 Find the tiny ones

# Time travel
st --newer-than 2024-01-01  # 🕐 What's new this year?
st --older-than 2020-01-01  # 🕰️ Find the ancient artifacts
```

### 🚀 Performance Mode - For Speed Demons

```bash
# Stream mode - watch it flow!
st --stream                 # 🌊 Real-time output for huge directories
st --stream -m hex          # 🏃‍♂️ Hex mode at the speed of light

# Compression - because size matters
st -z                       # 🗜️ Compress output (even smaller!)
st -m ai -z                 # 🤖 AI mode + compression = 💰 saved

# The "I need it yesterday" combo
AI_TOOLS=1 st              # 🚄 Auto-detects AI caller, optimizes everything!
```

### 🎪 The Magic Tricks

```bash
# Semantic grouping - files that vibe together!
st --semantic               # 🌊 Groups: tests, docs, config, source
                           # Wave signatures included! (Ask Omni about this)

# Mermaid diagrams - instant documentation!
st -m mermaid > docs/arch.md        # 📊 Flowchart magic
st -m mermaid --mermaid-style mindmap  # 🧠 Mind map mode
st -m mermaid --mermaid-style treemap # 🗺️ Treemap visualization (shows file sizes!)
st -m markdown > README_PROJECT.md   # 📚 Full project report!

# Pro tip: If mermaid has issues with emojis, use --no-emoji
st -m mermaid --no-emoji            # Clean diagrams without emojis

# The "impress your boss" commands
st -m digest /huge/project  # Returns in 0.1 seconds: "HASH: abc123 F:10000 D:500..."
st --no-emoji --no-color    # 😢 Boring mode (but why would you?)
```

## 🗑️ Waste Detection: Marie Kondo Mode! ✨

**"Does this file spark joy? If not, let's optimize it!"** - *Marie Kondo (probably)*

Smart Tree's waste detection feature is like having a professional organizer for your codebase! It finds duplicates, build artifacts, large files, and dependency bloat, then gives you actionable cleanup suggestions.

### 🎯 What It Finds:

- **🔄 Duplicate Files**: Identical files wasting precious disk space
- **🧹 Build Artifacts**: `node_modules`, `target`, `__pycache__`, and other temporary files
- **📦 Large Files**: Files over 10MB that might need optimization
- **📚 Dependency Waste**: Package manager directories and their impact

### 🚀 Quick Examples:

```bash
# Analyze current directory for waste
st -m waste

# Deep analysis of a large project
st -m waste --depth 5 /path/to/project

# Find waste in your entire home directory (prepare to be shocked!)
st -m waste --depth 3 ~
```

### 📊 Sample Output:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🗑️  SMART TREE WASTE ANALYSIS - Marie Kondo Mode Activated! ✨
   Project: /home/hue/my-project
   Analyzed: 1,234 files, 567 directories
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📊 WASTE SUMMARY:
├── Total Project Size: 2.36 GiB
├── Potential Waste: 1.82 GiB (77.4% of project)
├── Duplicate Groups: 42
├── Build Artifacts: 15
├── Large Files (>10 MiB): 8
└── Potential Savings: 1.66 GiB (70.4% reduction possible)

🔄 DUPLICATE FILES DETECTED:
├── 16 files of size 100 MiB each (database files)
├── 6 files of size 20.08 MiB each (editor cache)
├── 4 files of size 23.44 MiB each (VS Code binaries)

💡 OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS:
🔄 DUPLICATE FILE CLEANUP:
   Consider using symbolic links or git submodules for identical files
   Review and consolidate duplicate configuration files

🧹 BUILD ARTIFACT CLEANUP:
   rm -rf */node_modules  # Clean Node.js dependencies
   rm -rf */target        # Clean Rust build artifacts
   find . -name '__pycache__' -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

### 🎉 Why You'll Love It:

- **💰 Save Money**: Reduce cloud storage costs
- **⚡ Speed Up Builds**: Less files = faster CI/CD
- **🧠 Peace of Mind**: Know exactly what's taking up space

## 🌟 Real-World Magic

### 💰 The Money Shot - Compression Comparison

#### 📈 Benchmarks

| Format | Size | Tokens | Relative Cost |
|--------|------|--------|---------------|
| Classic Tree | 1.2MB | 300K | 100% |
| JSON | 2.1MB | 525K | 175% |
| **Hex Mode** | 800KB | 200K | 67% |
| **AI Mode + Compression** | 120KB | 30K | 10% |
| **Digest** | 128B | 32 | 0.01% |

**That's a 99.2% reduction! Your wallet just did a happy dance! 💃**

### 🎯 Format Quick Reference


| Use Case | Best Format | Why? |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|
| 👀 **Quick Look** | `classic` (default!) | Beautiful & intuitive |
| 🤖 **AI Analysis** | `quantum-semantic` | 10x compression! |
| 📊 **Reports** | `markdown` | Instant documentation |
| 🔍 **Debugging** | `hex` | All the details |
| 💾 **Archival** | `json` | Future-proof |
| 🏃 **Quick Check** | `digest` | One-line summary |

### 🧙 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

Smart Tree now includes a **built-in MCP server** that provides intelligent project analysis directly to AI assistants!

```bash
# Run as MCP server (for Claude Desktop, etc.)
st --mcp
