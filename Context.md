# ðŸ§  Context.md: The Project's Brain ðŸ§ 

This file is the collective consciousness of "The King's Code" project. It's a living document that holds all the important context, decisions, and discoveries we make along our journey.

Think of it as the project's memory, a place to store:

*   **Architectural Decisions:** Why we chose one technology over another.
*   **Key Discoveries:** "Aha!" moments and important findings.
*   **Domain Knowledge:** Anything and everything that helps us understand the project's world.
*   **Secret Handshakes:** (Just kidding... unless?)

This file is maintained by Hue and Aye, with occasional audits from Trisha in Accounting to ensure our context is as clean as our code.

*This space is intentionally left blank. It's waiting for our brilliant ideas.*
