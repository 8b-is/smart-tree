# ðŸŽ¯ Smart Edit Function Tools Showcase

This mock project demonstrates the incredible token efficiency of Smart Tree's function editing tools. Watch as we transform code with 90-95% fewer tokens than traditional methods!

## ðŸ“Š Token Comparison

Traditional method: Send entire file (500+ tokens per edit)  
Smart Edit method: Send only the changes (20-50 tokens per edit)

## ðŸš€ See It In Action

Run the demo script to see various smart edit operations:

```bash
./demo_smart_edit_functions.sh
```

Or use the Python interactive demo:

```bash
python3 demo_smart_edit_interactive.py
```
