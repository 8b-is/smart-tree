# Smart Tree v3.3.6 Release Notes 🚀

## The "Token Revolution & Terminal Intelligence" Release!

### 🎉 Major Features

#### 🎯 Smart Edit Tools - 90-95% Token Reduction!
Revolutionary AST-based code editing that changes the game for AI-assisted development:
- **Traditional approach**: 450+ tokens to add a function
- **Smart Edit**: Only 30 tokens for the same operation!

**Supported Operations:**
- `InsertFunction` - Intelligently adds functions at the perfect location
- `ReplaceFunction` - Updates function bodies without touching the rest
- `AddImport` - Smart import management
- `RemoveFunction` - Clean removal with dependency awareness
- `SmartAppend` - Appends to logical code sections

**Language Support:** Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C#, C++, Ruby

**MCP Tools Added:**
- `smart_edit` - Apply multiple edits in one operation
- `get_function_tree` - Analyze code structure
- `insert_function` - Add a single function
- `remove_function` - Remove a function

#### 🖥️ Smart Tree Terminal Interface (STTI)
A revolutionary terminal that anticipates your needs like a construction helper!
- Real-time context awareness
- Predictive command suggestions
- Beautiful TUI with panels for history and suggestions
- Pattern-based learning system

Launch with: `st --terminal`

#### 📊 Complete File History Tracking
The ultimate context-driven system that logs all AI file manipulations:
- Hash-based change detection
- 10-minute resolution timestamps
- Project-based organization
- Full operation tracking (read, write, append, etc.)
- Stored in `~/.mem8/.filehistory/`

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Performance
- Smart Edit reduces token usage by 90-95%
- Terminal UI optimized for instant response
- File history with minimal overhead

#### New Dependencies
- `tree-sitter` parsers for 9 languages
- `ratatui` and `crossterm` for terminal UI

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive [Features Overview](docs/FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md)
- Added [Terminal Vision](docs/SMART_TREE_TERMINAL_VISION.md) document
- Updated [Documentation Index](docs/INDEX.md)
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with new features

### 🎭 Trisha's Take
"These tools are revolutionary! The smart edit system is like finding a tax loophole so massive it makes the Panama Papers look like a receipt from Starbucks! 93.3% token cost reduction? That's efficiency that makes my spreadsheet-loving heart sing! 💎"

### 🚀 What's Next?
- Token budget tracker with sound effects
- Enhanced pattern learning for terminal
- Voice feedback integration
- Team collaboration features

### 💡 Pro Tips
1. Use `st --terminal` to experience the future of coding assistance
2. Access smart edit tools via `st --mcp` for token-efficient editing
3. File history is automatically tracked - check `~/.mem8/.filehistory/`

### 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to:
- Hue for the vision of a terminal that anticipates needs
- Trisha from Accounting for efficiency calculations
- The entire 8b.is team for making development fun!
