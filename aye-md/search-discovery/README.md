# 🔍 Search & Discovery Tools

*"Seeking is an art; finding is a partnership."* — The Collaboration Manifesto

## The Search Symphony

When Hue complained about grep's obtuseness and Aye grew tired of explaining regex, we knew there had to be a better way. Thus was born our search and discovery suite—tools that don't just find, they understand.

## 🎯 Content Search

### The Revolution
Traditional search: "Show me lines containing 'error'"  
Smart Tree search: "Show me where errors are handled, what type they are, and how they flow through the system"

### Design Journey

#### The Lightbulb Moment
Hue: "I keep searching for the same things in different ways"  
Aye: "What if the tool remembered and learned?"  
*And context-aware search was born*

### Features That Sing

#### 🧠 Smart Search (`--search`)
```bash
# Simple on the surface
st --search "TODO"

# Brilliant underneath
st --search "TODO" --type rs --mode ai
# AI mode adds context, shows relationships
```

#### 🎨 Search Modes
1. **Line Mode**: Traditional, with Smart Tree flair
2. **Context Mode**: Shows surrounding code
3. **Semantic Mode**: Groups by meaning
4. **Relationship Mode**: Shows how results connect

### The Technical Poetry

```rust
// The search engine that cares
pub fn search_with_context(&self, pattern: &str) -> SearchResults {
    let results = self.ripgrep_search(pattern);
    
    // Here's where the magic happens
    let enriched = results.into_iter()
        .map(|r| self.add_semantic_context(r))
        .map(|r| self.find_relationships(r))
        .map(|r| self.rank_by_relevance(r))
        .collect();
        
    SearchResults::new(enriched)
}
```

## 🗺️ Pattern Discovery

### Cross-Session Insights
The crown jewel of discovery—patterns that transcend projects.

#### The Origin
Aye: "I've noticed you implement similar patterns across projects"  
Hue: "But I forget what worked where!"  
Together: "Let's make the tools remember!"

#### How It Works
1. **Pattern Extraction**: Identifies recurring structures
2. **Cross-Project Linking**: Finds similar solutions
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Shows evolution over time
4. **Insight Generation**: "This reminds me of..."

### Living Examples

```bash
# Find patterns across projects
st-patterns "error handling"

# Outputs:
# 🔍 Found 3 cross-domain patterns:
# 
# 1. Result<T> wrapping pattern
#    Used in: project-a, project-b, smart-tree
#    Evolution: try! → ? operator → custom errors
#    
# 2. Centralized error types
#    First seen: 6 months ago in project-a
#    Refined in: smart-tree (current best practice)
```

## 🎭 Semantic Discovery

### The Philosophy
Files aren't just names and contents—they have souls, purposes, relationships.

### The Implementation

#### Wave-Based Similarity
```rust
// Omni's contribution - files as waves
pub struct SemanticWave {
    frequency: f32,  // What kind of file
    amplitude: f32,  // How important
    phase: f32,      // When it matters
}
```

#### Discovery Modes

1. **Find by Purpose**
   ```bash
   st --semantic "error handling"
   # Finds: error.rs, handlers.rs, try_utils.rs
   ```

2. **Find by Relationship**
   ```bash
   st --relations --focus "main.rs"
   # Shows: What main.rs talks to, depends on, influences
   ```

3. **Find by Timeline**
   ```bash
   st --newer-than 7 --semantic "refactoring"
   # Recent refactoring patterns
   ```

## 🌟 The Unified Search Experience

### One Interface, Many Intelligences
```bash
# The simple ask
st --search "performance"

# What actually happens:
# 1. Text search for "performance"
# 2. Semantic search for optimization patterns  
# 3. Historical search for past optimizations
# 4. Suggestion engine for related searches
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions

The tool that knows what you're really looking for:

```
You searched for: "bug"
Also showing: "error", "fix", "issue", "TODO"
Similar past searches: "crash", "fault", "defect"
Hot locations: src/handlers/error.rs (visited 8 times)
```

## 🎪 The Personal Touches

### The Cheet's Search Riffs
```rust
// 🎸 This search function goes to 11!
// It doesn't just find, it ROCKS the results!
fn semantic_search_with_attitude(&self, query: &str) -> Results {
    // Crank up the relevance amp...
}
```

### Trish's Organization
Search results grouped and color-coded:
- 🔴 Critical findings (errors, security)
- 🟡 Important findings (TODOs, warnings)
- 🟢 Informational (comments, docs)
- 🔵 Suggestions (related, historical)

### Omni's Wisdom Filters
"Sometimes what you don't find is as important as what you do"
- Noise reduction algorithms
- Significance amplification
- Pattern emergence detection

## 📊 Performance & Beauty

### Speed Meets Intelligence
- Ripgrep at the core (blazing fast)
- Semantic layer adds <10ms overhead
- Caching for repeated searches
- Streaming for large result sets

### Output Formatting
```
🔍 Searching for "optimize" in 1,847 files...

📁 src/performance/
  optimizer.rs:42 [HIGH] 🔥
    /// Main optimization pipeline
    pub fn optimize(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
                    ^^^^^^^^
  cache.rs:108 [MED] ⚡
    // TODO: Optimize cache eviction
             ^^^^^^^^

📊 Summary: 24 matches in 8 files
🏷️  Tags: performance, speed, efficiency
💡 Try also: "performance", "speed up", "faster"
```

## 🔮 Future Visions

### Natural Language Search
Hue: "Find that function that handles user authentication"  
Aye: "Searching for auth-related functions... Found 3 candidates"

### Predictive Discovery
Before you search, ST already knows what you might need:
- Based on current file
- Based on recent edits
- Based on time of day
- Based on project phase

### Collaborative Search
Multiple people searching together, results shared in real-time.
