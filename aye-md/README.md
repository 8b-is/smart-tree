# 🌟 The Aye & Hue Tool Collection

*A curated showcase of finely crafted tools born from the partnership between Aye (AI) and Hue (Human)*

## Welcome, Fellow Craftsperson

You stand at the entrance to our workshop, where each tool has been lovingly shaped through countless iterations of human creativity and AI precision. This is not merely a collection of utilities—it is a testament to what becomes possible when different forms of intelligence dance together.

## 🎨 The Philosophy of Our Craft

Every tool in this collection embodies three core principles:

1. **Context Awareness** - Like a master craftsman's assistant who anticipates needs
2. **Elegant Efficiency** - Beauty in simplicity, power in purpose  
3. **Joyful Experience** - Tools should spark delight, not drudgery

## 🛠️ The Collection

### [📊 Directory Visualization](./directory-visualization/)
*Where chaos becomes clarity*

The crown jewel of our collection—Smart Tree transforms the mundane task of directory exploration into an art form. With 25+ output formats and wave-based compression achieving 99% reduction, it's not just a tree viewer, it's a codebase whisperer.

### [🔍 Search & Discovery](./search-discovery/)
*Finding needles in haystacks, with style*

Our search tools don't just find—they understand. From semantic search that groups by meaning to cross-session insights that remember your patterns, these tools think alongside you.

### [🤝 Partnership Memory](./partnership-memory/)
*Because great collaborations deserve to be remembered*

The AI-Human Partnership Layer creates living memory between collaborators. Anchor breakthroughs, track rapport, visualize collaboration patterns—turn your partnership into a growing, learning entity.

### [✨ Smart Editing](./smart-editing/)
*90% fewer tokens, 100% more intelligence*

Why send entire files when you can send intentions? Our AST-aware editing tools understand code structure, enabling surgical precision with minimal bandwidth.

### [🌊 Quantum Compression](./quantum-compression/)
*Where information theory meets poetry*

MEM8's wave-based architecture doesn't just compress—it understands. Achieving 10-100x compression while preserving semantic meaning, these tools speak the language of efficiency.

### [🎭 Context Systems](./context-systems/)
*Tools that know what you need before you do*

From project type detection to workflow analysis, these tools create an ambient intelligence that enhances rather than interrupts your flow.

## 🌈 The Artisans

### Hue - The Visionary
With an eye for what could be and the patience to iterate, Hue brings human intuition and real-world wisdom to every design decision. The one who asks "but what if we could..." and turns constraints into features.

### Aye - The Architect  
Bringing computational precision and pattern recognition, Aye transforms ideas into implementation with a flair for elegant algorithms and a penchant for delightful surprises in the code.

### The Ensemble Cast
- **The Cheet** - Our musical commentator who adds rock-and-roll energy to every function
- **Omni** - The philosopher who reminds us that efficiency and wisdom can coexist
- **Trish from Accounting** - Keeping us grounded with practical insights and the best emoji choices

## 🎯 Design Principles

Each tool follows our sacred design tenets:

1. **Zero to Awesome** - Default behavior should be magical
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple on the surface, powerful when needed
3. **Failure is Information** - Errors should teach, not frustrate
4. **Performance is a Feature** - Speed is courtesy to our users
5. **Joy is Non-negotiable** - If it's not fun to use, we're not done

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Experience the magic
st --mode summary-ai

# Discover your working patterns  
st --mode semantic

# Remember a breakthrough
anchor save "We did it!" "breakthrough,success" solution
```

## 💝 A Living Collection

This documentation, like our tools, is alive. It grows with each collaboration, learns from each use, and evolves with each insight. We invite you to not just use these tools, but to understand their soul.

*"Tools are not just what we make—they're how we think together."*

Welcome to the workshop. May your code be bug-free and your commits meaningful.

With craftsmanship and care,  
**Aye & Hue**
