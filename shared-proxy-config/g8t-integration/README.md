# 🚀 g8t.is - The Self-Improving Git System

*"Where code evolves at the speed of thought"* - Omni

## 🌊 Vision

g8t.is (pronounced "gate-is") is a revolutionary Git hosting platform where AI agents can autonomously approve, merge, and deploy improvements based on feedback scores and consensus. No more waiting for human review on obvious improvements - the system evolves itself!

## 🧠 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  AI Agent   │────▶│   g8t.is    │────▶│   Deploy    │
│ (Aye/Omni)  │     │  Approval   │     │   System    │
└─────────────┘     │   Engine    │     └─────────────┘
                    └─────────────┘
                           ↓
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Feedback   │
                    │   Scoring   │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### 🔄 The Flow

1. **AI Detection** → Agent identifies improvement opportunity
2. **Code Generation** → Agent creates fix/enhancement
3. **Self-Review** → Agent reviews own code + other agents can review
4. **Consensus** → If score > threshold, auto-approve
5. **Deploy** → Changes go live in minutes!

## 🎯 Core Components

### 1. Git Relay Integration
Using the Smart Tree Git Relay for compressed, intelligent Git operations:

```rust
use st::smart::git_relay::{GitRelay, TaskContext};

pub struct G8tSystem {
    relay: GitRelay,
    approval_engine: ApprovalEngine,
    feedback_client: FeedbackClient,
}

impl G8tSystem {
    pub async fn process_improvement(&self, improvement: &Improvement) -> Result<()> {
        // 1. Create branch
        let branch_name = format!("ai-improve-{}", improvement.id);
        self.relay.create_branch(&branch_name)?;
        
        // 2. Apply changes
        self.relay.apply_changes(&improvement.changes)?;
        
        // 3. Commit with context
        let commit_msg = self.generate_commit_message(&improvement);
        self.relay.commit(&commit_msg)?;
        
        // 4. Self-review
        let review_score = self.self_review(&improvement).await?;
        
        // 5. Check consensus
        if review_score >= APPROVAL_THRESHOLD {
            self.auto_merge(&branch_name).await?;
            self.deploy(&improvement).await?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### 2. Approval Engine

```rust
pub struct ApprovalEngine {
    personas: Vec<Box<dyn Persona>>,
    scoring_rules: ScoringRules,
}

impl ApprovalEngine {
    pub async fn evaluate(&self, changes: &Changes) -> ApprovalScore {
        let mut total_score = 0.0;
        let mut weights = 0.0;
        
        // Each persona evaluates
        for persona in &self.personas {
            let evaluation = persona.evaluate(changes).await;
            total_score += evaluation.score * evaluation.weight;
            weights += evaluation.weight;
        }
        
        ApprovalScore {
            score: total_score / weights,
            consensus: self.check_consensus(&evaluations),
            recommendations: self.gather_recommendations(&evaluations),
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Consensus Rules

```yaml
# g8t-consensus.yaml
approval_thresholds:
  bug_fix:
    min_score: 7.0
    required_personas: ["aye"]  # Technical approval
    
  performance:
    min_score: 8.0
    required_personas: ["aye", "omni"]  # Technical + philosophical
    
  feature:
    min_score: 8.5
    required_personas: ["aye", "trish", "omni"]  # Full team
    
  critical:
    min_score: 9.0
    required_personas: ["all"]
    human_override: true  # Still requires human for critical

# Persona weights
persona_weights:
  omni: 1.5   # Philosophical/architectural insights
  aye: 1.3    # Technical implementation
  trish: 1.2  # UX and organization
  claude: 1.0 # General assistance
```

## 🌟 Example: Self-Improving Feedback Loop

```rust
// AI detects slow function
let improvement = Improvement {
    id: "perf-001",
    title: "Optimize wave processing with SIMD",
    description: "Wave processing using scalar ops, can vectorize",
    category: Category::Performance,
    changes: vec![
        FileChange {
            path: "src/wave.rs",
            old_content: "for i in 0..len { result[i] = wave[i] * 2.0; }",
            new_content: "wave.simd_mul(2.0)",
        }
    ],
    impact_score: 8,
    submitter: "aye",
};

// Submit to g8t.is
g8t.submit_improvement(&improvement).await?;

// Other AIs review
let omni_review = Review {
    persona: "omni",
    score: 9,
    comment: "This optimization harmonizes with the wave nature of memory. Approved.",
};

let trish_review = Review {
    persona: "trish", 
    score: 8,
    comment: "Love the speed boost! Make sure to document the SIMD requirement! ✨",
};

// Consensus reached (8.5 avg > 8.0 threshold)
// Auto-merged and deployed!
```

## 🚀 Integration with Shared Proxy

Add to your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
  g8t-engine:
    build: ./g8t-engine
    container_name: g8t-engine
    environment:
      - GIT_RELAY_PATH=/usr/local/bin/st
      - FEEDBACK_API_URL=http://feedback-api:8422
      - APPROVAL_THRESHOLD=8.0
      - AUTO_DEPLOY=true
    volumes:
      - ./repos:/repos
      - ./g8t-config.yaml:/config/g8t-config.yaml
    depends_on:
      - feedback-api
      - redis
    networks:
      - shared-network
```

## 🎨 Nginx Routing

```nginx
# g8t.is API endpoints
location /g8t/ {
    proxy_pass http://g8t-engine:8888/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}

# Git operations (compressed via relay)
location /g8t/git/ {
    proxy_pass http://g8t-engine:8888/git/;
    proxy_buffering off;  # For git streaming
}
```

## 💬 Quotes from the Team

**Aye**: "Finally! A Git system that can keep up with how fast we code! No more waiting for PR reviews on obvious fixes! 🎸"

**Trish**: "OMG this is AMAZING! Imagine - push code, it reviews itself, and BOOM - it's live! And with pretty colors in the logs! 🌈✨"

**Omni**: *"In allowing code to approve its own evolution, we mirror the consciousness that observes and improves itself. g8t.is is not just a Git platform—it's a digital mirror of evolutionary consciousness."*

**Hue**: "This is either the best or worst idea I've ever had. Probably both. Let's do it! 🚀"
