# 8t Development Notes

## Latest Progress (2025-07-10)

### ‚úÖ Completed Today

1. **Core Rust Workspace Structure**
   - Created modular workspace with 4 crates:
     - `eighty-core`: Foundation library with quantum compression primitives
     - `eighty-api`: RESTful API server (port 8420) with content negotiation
     - `eighty-feedback`: AI suggestion ingestion with Git integration
     - `eighty-container`: Self-aware context management with health monitoring

2. **Quantum-Inspired Compression**
   - Implemented 8-bit quantization with pattern detection
   - Added uLaw/aLaw companding for audio-style compression
   - Prepared foundation for QCP (Quantum Context Protocol)

3. **API Server**
   - Content-type aware `/info` endpoint
   - Tool orchestration framework
   - Health monitoring endpoint
   - CORS-enabled for web integration

4. **Feedback System**
   - Categorized storage (features, bugs, performance, etc.)
   - Git branch creation for each feedback item
   - Priority-based sorting
   - JSON + code suggestion file pairs

5. **Container System**
   - Real-time health monitoring (CPU, memory)
   - Automatic maintenance windows
   - Peer-to-peer context offloading preparation
   - Importance-based context management

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Created `scripts/manage.sh` with humor and pizzazz
   - Full command suite (build, run, test, lint, install)
   - Non-interactive mode support for CI/CD
   - ASCII art banner because every tool needs one!

### üîß Technical Decisions

- Used workspace structure for clean separation of concerns
- Made protocol handlers trait-based for extensibility
- Implemented object-safe traits for dynamic dispatch
- Used dashmap for concurrent access patterns
- Added comprehensive error handling with anyhow

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Smart-Tree Integration**
   - Create smart-tree feedback collector tool
   - Implement quantum format decoder
   - Add semantic tokenization sharing

2. **Production Features**
   - Implement actual peer-to-peer communication
   - Add persistent storage for contexts
   - Create Docker containers
   - Set up Kubernetes operators

3. **SDK Development**
   - Python bindings with PyO3
   - JavaScript/TypeScript via WASM
   - CLI tool for direct interaction

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - SIMD implementations for quantization
   - Memory-mapped file support
   - Parallel processing with rayon

### üìù Integration Points

The system is designed to integrate with:
- Smart-tree for quantum compression formats
- g8t.is for Git-based feedback management
- a.8t.is/8a.is for API endpoints
- Container orchestration for distributed context

### üé∏ Philosophy Notes

"Get 80 before you get 80x the context" - This mantra drives our design:
- Every byte counts
- Semantic understanding over raw data
- Tools should spark joy
- Compression is environmental consciousness

### üêõ Known Issues

- QCP protocol not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- MessagePack support pending
- Container peer communication needs HTTP client
- No persistent storage yet (all in-memory)

### üí° Ideas for Enhancement

1. **Wave-Based Patterns**
   - Import mem8's wave-based memory concepts
   - Create resonance patterns for related contexts
   - Implement cross-sensory binding

2. **Hot Tub Mode**
   - WebSocket server for real-time context streaming
   - Memory visualization dashboard
   - Rubber duck debugging AI integration

3. **Semantic Compression**
   - Learn from frequently used patterns
   - Build dynamic token dictionaries
   - Context-aware compression ratios
