# Smart Tree Installation Helper for Claude Desktop ðŸŒ³

This extension helps you install and configure Smart Tree, the world's smartest directory visualization tool!

## What This Extension Does

The Smart Tree Installation Helper is a friendly guide that:

2. **Provides Instructions** - Platform-specific installation steps
3. **Helps Configure** - Shows exactly how to set up Claude Desktop
4. **Verifies Success** - Confirms everything is working

- âœ… **Terminal Access** - Use `st` anywhere, not just Claude
- âœ… **Easy Updates** - Update Smart Tree independently
