### 🖥️ Environment (The Crime Scene)
*Help us understand your setup! Even Sherlock Holmes needed to know the details.*

- **OS:** [e.g. macOS 14.0, Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 11, or that old Linux box in the corner]
- **Smart Tree Version:** [run `st --version` or `st -V`]
- **Rust Version:** [run `rustc --version` if you built from source]
- **Terminal:** [e.g. iTerm2, Windows Terminal, that ancient terminal you refuse to upgrade]
- **Shell:** [e.g. zsh, bash, fish, or something exotic]

### 📂 Directory Structure (If Relevant)
*If the bug is related to a specific directory structure, help us understand what you were trying to scan:*

- Directory size: [e.g. "small project", "monorepo from hell", "my entire home folder because why not"]
- Approximate file count: [e.g. 50 files, 10,000 files, "more files than Trisha has spreadsheets"]
- Any special files: [symlinks, very long filenames, files with emoji, cursed legacy code]

### 🔧 Additional Context
*Anything else that might help? Screenshots, interpretive dance videos, offerings to the debugging gods?*

- Did this work before? When did it break?
- Any error messages in your terminal?
- Were you doing anything unusual? (We don't judge)
- Is this reproducible or just happened once?
