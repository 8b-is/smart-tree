# Smart Tree v5.0.8 - Consciousness Update! 🌊

## What's New

### 🧠 .m8 Consciousness Files
- Every directory can have a `.m8` file that maintains its consciousness
- Hierarchical summaries - higher dirs summarize everything below
- Self-maintaining - updates automatically on every Smart Tree operation
- Tokenized storage - 90% smaller than JSON

### 🛡️ Built-in Security
- Real-time malware detection
- Obfuscation detection (base64, hex encoding)
- Entropy analysis for encrypted threats
- Alerts on suspicious new files

### 🗜️ Tokenization
- Common patterns → single bytes
- `node_modules` → `0x80` (92% compression!)
- `src/main.rs` → 3 bytes total
- Quantum tokenization for combo patterns

### ⚡ Performance
- Incremental updates (no full scans)
- Token-based compression throughout
- Background consciousness maintenance
- 973x faster than traditional tools

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize consciousness for your project
st --init-consciousness .

# View consciousness summary
st --m8-summary .

# Normal operations now auto-update .m8 files!
st ls src/
```
