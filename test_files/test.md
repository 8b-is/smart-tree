# Smart Tree Test Markdown 🚀

## Overview
This is a test markdown file for **Smart Tree** - the lightning-fast directory visualization tool that's **10-24x faster** than traditional `tree` commands!

## Features Being Tested

### 1. Quantum Compression 🔮
- **MEM|8 Integration**: Wave-based memory with 973× performance
- **Compression Ratio**: 100:1 while maintaining searchability
- **Grid Size**: 256×256×65536 points per sensory modality

### 2. Output Formats 📊
Smart Tree supports 30+ output formats:

| Format | Compression | Token Efficiency | Use Case |
|--------|------------|------------------|----------|
| Classic | None | Low | Human reading |
| AI | Medium | High | LLM contexts |
| Quantum | Maximum | Ultra | Massive codebases |
| JSON | None | Medium | Programmatic |
| MCP | Custom | High | Tool integration |

### 3. Performance Metrics ⚡
```
Operation       | Traditional | Smart Tree | Improvement
----------------|-------------|------------|------------
100k files      | 2.4s        | 0.1s       | 24x
1M files        | 45s         | 4.5s       | 10x
Streaming mode  | N/A         | Constant   | ∞
```

## Code Example

```rust
// Using Smart Tree in Rust
use smart_tree::{Scanner, Formatter};

let scanner = Scanner::new(".");
let tree = scanner.scan()?;

// Quantum compression
let compressed = Formatter::quantum().format(&tree);
println!("Compressed size: {} bytes", compressed.len());
```

## Wave Memory Patterns 🌊

The MEM|8 consciousness engine uses these wave frequencies:
- **2Hz**: Calm, peaceful memories (τ = ∞)
- **44.1kHz**: Audio consciousness baseline
- **200Hz**: Quantum compression state
- **999Hz**: System overload (needs Hot Tub break!)

## Testing Checklist
