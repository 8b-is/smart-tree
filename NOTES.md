# NOTES.md - Latest Development Updates

## v3.1 Quantum Revolution (July 2025)

### MEM|8 Quantum Compression Achievement ðŸš€
- **99% Compression Ratio**: Chromium source (487MB â†’ 4.1MB)
- **$1,270 Cost Savings**: Per large directory analysis
- **Native Quantum Architecture**: Tree walker outputs quantum format directly
- **Token Mapping Engine**: Smart tokenization with semantic equivalence
- **New Output Modes**:
  - `quantum`: Native 8x compression with token mapping
  - `claude`: Base64+zlib 10x compression (default for AI)
- **Python Examples**: Visualization, analysis, diff, and semantic tools
- **DXT Integration**: Fixed installer for Claude Desktop compatibility

### Performance Breakthroughs
- **10-24x Faster**: Than traditional tree command
- **Constant Memory**: ~50MB regardless of directory size
- **Streaming Default**: Handles million-file directories smoothly
- **Zero Overhead**: Native quantum output without conversion

## Recent Changes (December 2024)

### Performance and Usability Improvements (Dec 21)
- **Fixed O(nÂ²) performance bug** in classic formatter that caused hanging with deep directories
- **Changed default depth from 10 to 5** to prevent excessive processing on deep structures
- **Added `--everything` flag** - master switch that enables --all, --no-ignore, and --no-default-ignore
- **Clarified size calculations** - st reports actual file sizes, while `du` reports disk blocks

## Recent Changes (December 2024)

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Integration
We've added a built-in MCP server that allows AI assistants like Claude to directly analyze directories:
- `--mcp` flag runs Smart Tree as an MCP server on stdio
- `--mcp-tools` lists available MCP tools for debugging
- `--mcp-config` shows the configuration needed for Claude Desktop
- Tools include: `analyze_directory`, `find_files`, `get_statistics`, `get_digest`
- Includes caching support for repeated queries
- Security features with allowed/blocked path configuration

### Content Search Feature
- Added `--search` flag to search for keywords within file contents
- Works in combination with `--type` filter for targeted searches
- Example: `st --search "TODO" --type rs` finds all TODOs in Rust files
- Efficient implementation that streams file contents

### Streaming Mode
- Added `--stream` flag for real-time output on large directories
- Progressive output as directories are scanned
- Better user experience for massive file trees
- Prevents timeout issues on slow filesystems

### AI JSON Wrapper
- Added `--ai-json` flag that wraps AI output in JSON structure
- Makes it easier for programmatic consumption
- Maintains all the benefits of the compact AI format

## Current Work in Progress

### v3.0 Vision
- Quantum visualization in 3D/VR environments
- AI code intelligence using token patterns
- Distributed quantum scanning across networks
- Hot Tub Mode for collaborative analysis
- Wave interference patterns for memory optimization

### Documentation Improvements
- âœ… Mode selection guide created
- âœ… Python examples for quantum format
- âœ… Updated roadmap with v2.0 achievements
- Video tutorials for quantum features planned

## Known Issues
- Streaming mode doesn't work with compression (by design)
- MCP server needs better error messages for permission denied
- Search feature could be faster for binary files

## Future Ideas
- Add regex support to search feature
- Implement incremental updates for MCP cache
- Add WebSocket support for MCP server
- Consider adding a TUI mode for interactive exploration
- Integration with other AI providers beyond Claude

## Testing Notes
- MCP server tested with Claude Desktop on Linux
- Search feature tested on codebases up to 1M files
- Streaming mode tested on network filesystems
- Need more Windows testing for MCP features

## Dependencies Added
- `tokio` for async MCP server (feature-gated)
- Additional serialization for MCP protocol
- No new runtime dependencies for core functionality
