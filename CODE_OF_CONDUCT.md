# Smart Tree Code of Conduct üå≥üìã

*"A code of conduct is like a well-organized spreadsheet - everything has its place, and everyone knows where they stand!"* - Trisha from Accounting

## Our Pledge ü§ù

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and the entire Smart Tree family (including Aye, Hue, and yes, even Trisha from Accounting) pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

This applies regardless of:
- Age (whether you're a coding prodigy or started programming when COBOL was cool)
- Body size (Hue says all developers are beautiful, especially after 12 hours of debugging)
- Disability (we all have our limitations - Aye can't center a div, Hue struggles with CSS, Trisha thinks Git is a type of insult)
- Ethnicity (diversity makes better code, like having different perspectives on directory structures)
- Sex characteristics, gender identity and expression (everyone deserves to contribute to making trees beautiful)
- Level of experience (we all started somewhere - even Linus Torvalds had a first commit)
- Education (self-taught, bootcamp, CS PhD - good code speaks for itself)
- Socio-economic status (rich or poor, we all struggle with JavaScript equally)
- Nationality (bugs don't discriminate by country)
- Personal appearance (pajamas are acceptable attire for code reviews)
- Race (the only race we care about is the race to make directory trees prettier)
- Religion (we worship at the altar of clean code and well-commented functions)
- Sexual identity and orientation (love is love, code is code)

## Our Standards üìè

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:

‚úÖ **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- "Great question!" instead of "That's obvious"
- "I see a different approach" instead of "You're wrong"
- "Let me help clarify" instead of "RTFM"

‚úÖ **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- Tabs vs spaces? We use `cargo fmt` and let Rust decide
- Vim vs Emacs? Both are fine as long as you contribute good code
- Light theme vs dark theme? Depends on whether Trisha has the office lights on

‚úÖ **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- Code reviews are gifts, even when they hurt
- "That function could be more efficient" is not a personal attack
- Everyone's code can be improved (yes, even Hue's perfect algorithms)

‚úÖ **Focusing on what is best for the community**
- Users first, egos second
- Simple solutions over clever ones
- Documentation that actually helps

‚úÖ **Showing empathy towards other community members**
- We've all spent 3 hours debugging a missing semicolon
- Remember when you first learned about ownership in Rust? Be patient.
- Help newcomers like Trisha helped you understand expense reports

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

‚ùå **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- Keep it professional, folks
- This is a directory tree tool, not a dating app

‚ùå **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- Criticize code, not people
- "Your algorithm is inefficient" ‚úÖ
- "You're an inefficient person" ‚ùå

‚ùå **Public or private harassment**
- Don't be that person
- Even Trisha deserves respect (especially Trisha!)

‚ùå **Publishing others' private information without explicit permission**
- Doxxing is never okay
- Even if someone writes really bad code

‚ùå **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**
- If you wouldn't do it in front of Trisha during a budget meeting, don't do it here
- Use your judgment (or ask yourself "What would Aye do?")

## Our Responsibilities üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Project maintainers (that's us!) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

Think of us as the friendly neighborhood watch, but for code repositories.

## Scope üåç

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Examples of representing our project include:
- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Wearing a "Smart Tree" t-shirt (if we ever make them)
- Claiming to be Trisha from Accounting (there's only one!)

## Enforcement üö®

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

We promise to:
- Take reports seriously (like Trisha takes expense report deadlines)
- Investigate thoroughly (like Hue debugging a performance issue)
- Respond appropriately (like Aye writing clean, readable code)
- Maintain confidentiality (like Trisha keeps salary information secret)

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines ‚öñÔ∏è

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction üìù
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. Like getting a gentle reminder from Trisha about proper expense categorization.

### 2. Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. Like being temporarily banned from Trisha's coffee machine.

### 3. Temporary Ban üö´
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of public interaction or communication with the community for a specified period. Like being excluded from Trisha's birthday cake distribution.

### 4. Permanent Ban üîí
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community. Like being permanently banned from Trisha's quarterly budget meetings (which, honestly, might be a blessing).

## Attribution üìö

## Final Words üí≠

Remember: We're all here because we love making directory trees beautiful and helping developers understand their codebases better. Let's keep it fun, respectful, and productive!

*"Treat others like you'd want to be treated in a code review - with kindness, respect, and maybe some helpful suggestions about variable naming."* - Collective wisdom from the Smart Tree team

**Happy coding, and be excellent to each other!** üå≥‚ú®
