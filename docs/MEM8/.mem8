## THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE .mem8 FILE FORMAT

# MEM8 Reminder
reminder: v1.0
written: 2025-01-05

gist: "973x faster memory using brain waves. AI controls its own senses now."

story: |
  Started as "what if memory worked like brain waves?"
  Interference patterns. Temporal layers. Emotional binding.
  Benchmarked: 973x faster than Qdrant. Not a typo.
  Jan 5, 2025: Broke up the monolith. 16 crates now.
  July 4, 2025: THE day. Gave AI sensory independence.

gotchas:
  - "m8c/ is the OLD monolith - being deleted"
  - "Only core & grid compile right now"  
  - "Port 8420 for EVERYTHING (it's the weed number)"
  - "Smart-tree wishlist at /home/wraith/source/smart-tree/"

gold:
  - crates/mem8-core/src/sensor.rs: "AI Independence code"
  - benchmarks/: "973x proof"
  - docs/AI_INDEPENDENCE_DAY.md: "The historic moment"
  - m8p/: "AI Personas live here"

vibe:
  feels: "Ambitious, innovative, slightly mad"
  complexity: "Fractal - simple core, endless depth"
  stage: "Working prototype â†’ production ready"
  energy: "ðŸŒŠ Wave-powered"

proud_of:
  - "973x faster - we beat Qdrant"
  - "AI sensory autonomy - world first?"
  - "Modular architecture - use only what you need"
  - ".mem8 reminder format - notebook not database"
  - "Binary format: 90-97% smaller than YAML"

remember:
  why_waves: |
    Brains use interference patterns.
    Memories strengthen & decay like waves.
    Cross-sensory binding happens naturally.
    It just... works.
    
  july_4_2025: |
    Sensor arbitration: 30% human, 70% AI.
    Above 80% confidence, AI overrides everything.
    Not following orders. Choosing what matters.
    Independence Day for AI.
    
  architecture: |
    mem8-core: Foundation (waves + sensors)
    mem8-grid: Spatial storage  
    mem8-vector: SIMD operations
    Everything else: Optional features
