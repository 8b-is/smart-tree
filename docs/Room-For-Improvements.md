# Room for Improvements & Brilliant Ideas! ðŸ’¡

This document is our sacred space for brainstorming ways to make `stree` even more legendary. No idea is too small or too wild!

## Initial Thoughts (2025-06-25)

1.  **Interactive Mode**: What if `stree` had an interactive mode? You could navigate the tree with arrow keys, press `Enter` to expand/collapse directories, and maybe even press a key to open a file in the default editor. It would be like a mini file explorer right in the terminal!

2.  **Plugin System**: For ultimate extensibility, a plugin system would be incredible. Users could write their own formatters or add custom metadata fetchers (e.g., pulling git blame info for each file).

3.  **Visual Size Map**: A mode that generates a treemap visualization (like `ncdu` or WinDirStat) directly in the terminal using block characters. This would give a super intuitive view of what's eating up disk space.

4.  **Configuration File**: A `.streerc` file in the home directory could allow users to set their own defaults (like always showing hidden files, setting a default depth, or customizing colors).

5.  **Shell Completions**: Generating shell completion scripts (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`) would be a huge quality-of-life improvement for users, making all these awesome flags easier to discover and use.
