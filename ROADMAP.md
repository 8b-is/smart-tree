# üó∫Ô∏è Smart Tree Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (MVP)
- [ ] Basic directory traversal with `walkdir`
- [ ] Permission handling (show `*` for denied directories)
- [ ] Classic tree output format
- [ ] Hex output format
- [ ] Basic statistics collection
- [ ] `.gitignore` support with `globset`

## Phase 2: Search and Filtering
- [ ] `--find` implementation with pattern matching
- [ ] File type filtering
- [ ] Size filtering (parse human-readable sizes)
- [ ] Date filtering with `chrono`
- [ ] Depth limiting
- [ ] Show ignored directories in brackets

## Phase 3: Output Formats
- [ ] JSON output with `serde_json`
- [ ] CSV/TSV output
- [ ] AI mode (hex + stats combined)
- [ ] Colored output with `colored` crate
- [ ] No-emoji mode

## Phase 4: Performance
- [ ] Parallel directory scanning with `rayon`
- [ ] Progress bar for large directories with `indicatif`
- [ ] Memory-efficient streaming for huge trees
- [ ] SIMD optimizations for pattern matching

## Phase 5: Compression and Distribution
- [ ] Zlib compression with `flate2`
- [ ] Static binary builds
- [ ] Cross-platform releases (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Debian/RPM packages
- [ ] Homebrew formula

## Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Watch mode (monitor directory changes)
- [ ] Diff mode (compare two directory trees)
- [ ] Export to various formats (HTML, Markdown)
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Rust?
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than Python implementation
- **Memory Safety**: No segfaults or memory leaks
- **Single Binary**: Easy distribution, no runtime dependencies
- **Parallelism**: Safe concurrent directory traversal
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time

### Key Libraries
- `walkdir`: Efficient recursive directory traversal
- `clap`: Modern CLI argument parsing
- `serde`: Serialization for JSON/structured output
- `rayon`: Data parallelism for performance
- `globset`: Fast gitignore pattern matching
- `flate2`: Compression support

### Design Principles
1. **Speed First**: Should handle millions of files effortlessly
2. **Token Efficient**: Every byte counts for AI consumption
3. **User Friendly**: Intuitive CLI with helpful defaults
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new output formats
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works everywhere Rust runs

## Benchmarks Goals
- Traverse 1M files in < 1 second
- Memory usage < 100MB for typical projects
- Compressed output 10x smaller than original
- Pattern matching at GB/s speeds

## Future Ideas
- Web UI for interactive exploration
- Integration with `fd`, `rg`, and other Rust tools
- Smart caching for repeated traversals
- Machine learning for intelligent filtering
- Cloud storage support (S3, GCS, etc.)
