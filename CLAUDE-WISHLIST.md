# Smart-Tree Wishlist & Improvements

Based on analyzing the MEM8 documentation and using smart-tree extensively, here are improvement suggestions and feature requests:

## MEM8 Binary Format Integration (.mem8 files)

### Priority 1: Complete .mem8 Support
The MEM8 documentation describes a powerful binary format for semantic context, but smart-tree doesn't fully leverage it yet:

1. **Binary .mem8 Parser**
   - Implement the full binary specification from MEM8_BINARY_FORMAT.md
   - Support all 8 section types (Identity, Context, Structure, Compilation, Cache, AI Context, Relationships, Sensor Arbitration)
   - Add CRC32 validation and string table deduplication
   - Enable zstd compression for files >1KB

2. **Context-Aware Tree Display**
   - Show semantic annotations from .mem8 files inline with directory listings
   - Display compilation status (✅/⚠️/🔧) based on Section 0x04
   - Include purpose and key concepts from Sections 0x01-0x02
   - Show sensor arbitration weights for MEM8-specific directories

3. **Smart Caching with .mem8**
   - Use Section 0x05 (Cache) for instant directory state validation
   - Skip rescanning if directory CRC matches
   - Leverage content SHA256 for deep validation when needed

### Priority 2: Enhanced Search & Analysis

1. **Semantic Search via .mem8**
   ```bash
   st find --concept "wave_patterns"  # Search by concepts in .mem8 files
   st find --status "failed"          # Find dirs with compilation failures
   st find --type "rust_library"      # Find by project type
   ```

2. **Context-Aware File Content Search**
   - Show actual line content in search results (not just line numbers)
   - Group results by semantic context from .mem8
   - Prioritize results based on "importance" field (Section 0x02)

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Parse relationships from Section 0x07
   - Visualize upstream/downstream dependencies
   - Track compilation cascades (what breaks if X fails)

### Priority 3: Performance & Compression

1. **M8A Archive Format**
   - Implement the compact archive format for multiple .mem8 files
   - Support batch operations on entire project trees
   - Enable streaming decompression for large archives

2. **Quantum Format Enhancement**
   - Integrate .mem8 context into quantum compression
   - Use string table indices instead of full paths
   - Achieve the documented 97% compression for full projects

### Priority 4: Developer Experience

1. **Auto-Generate .mem8 Files**
   ```bash
   st init-mem8 /project  # Analyze and create draft .mem8 files
   st update-mem8         # Update existing .mem8 with current state
   ```

2. **IDE-Style Features**
   - Find symbol definitions (struct/trait/fn)
   - Show import relationships 
   - Track file modifications vs .mem8 cache

3. **Git Integration**
   - Show which .mem8 files are outdated
   - Generate semantic diffs ("concept changes" not just file changes)
   - Pre-commit hooks to update .mem8 metadata

## 🎓 Progressive Tips System

### Smart Tips That Learn From Usage
**Current**: Tips always show the same amount (if terminal + human mode)
**Proposed**: Tips progressively fade as users gain experience

**Implementation**:
```rust
// ~/.config/smart-tree/usage.toml
[usage]
total_runs = 47
last_run = "2025-01-10T15:23:45Z"
tip_level = 2  // 3=verbose (new user), 2=moderate, 1=minimal, 0=off
last_tips_shown = ["tip_id_1", "tip_id_5", "tip_id_12"]

[preferences]
tips_enabled = true
tips_fade_after = 20  // Start fading after 20 uses
tips_off_after = 100  // Turn off completely after 100 uses
```

**Behavior**:
- First 20 runs: Show 3 random tips (verbose mode)
- Runs 21-50: Show 2 tips (moderate mode)  
- Runs 51-100: Show 1 tip (minimal mode)
- After 100: No tips (expert mode)
- Can override with `--tips always|never|auto`
- Track shown tips to avoid repetition
- Reset with `st --reset-tips`

**Example Evolution**:
```bash
# Run 1-20 (New User):
💡 Deep trees can be overwhelming. Try --mode ls -d 1 for clean listings!
🚀 Pro tip: Set ST_DEFAULT_MODE=ls for instant directory listings!
✨ Try --mode waste to find duplicate files and reclaim disk space!

# Run 21-50 (Intermediate):
💡 Try --mode waste to find duplicate files!
🚀 Set ST_DEFAULT_MODE=ls to make ls your default!

# Run 51-100 (Advanced):
💡 New in v3.2: --mode waste finds duplicates!

# Run 100+ (Expert):
[No tips shown]
```

**Benefits**:
- New users get maximum help
- Experienced users get cleaner output
- Respects user expertise progression
- Can always re-enable if needed

## 🚀 Interactive Onboarding & Personalization

### First-Run Experience That Learns YOU
**Current**: Smart Tree uses hardcoded defaults that might not match your workflow
**Proposed**: Interactive setup wizard that creates a personalized config

**Triggers**:
- First run ever (no config file exists)
- `st --demo` or `st --setup`
- `st --reconfigure` to change preferences

**Interactive Flow**:
```bash
$ st

sudo_paths = ["/etc", "/usr/local", "/var/log", "/root"]
permission_warnings = true
suggest_sudo_command = true

# Even smarter - track YOUR common sudo mistakes:
[learned_patterns]
sudo_required_files = [
  "/etc/hosts",
  "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf",
  "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"  # If owned by root
]
```

**Benefits**:
- First run is personalized, not generic
- Learns YOUR workflow and preferences
- Prevents common permission headaches
- Discovers your large directories automatically
- Sets up useful aliases
- Can reconfigure anytime

**Advanced Personalization**:
```toml
[contextual_defaults]
# Different defaults for different directories
"~/source" = { mode = "summary-ai", depth = 2 }
"~/Documents" = { mode = "ls", depth = 1, sort = "date" }
"/etc" = { mode = "ls", warn_sudo = true }
"~/Downloads" = { mode = "waste", show_sizes = true }

[workflow_optimizations]
# Detect project types and adjust
rust_projects = { show_target = false, highlight = ["Cargo.toml", "src/"] }
node_projects = { show_node_modules = false, highlight = ["package.json"] }
```

This makes Smart Tree truly SMART - it adapts to each user's unique needs!

## 🍒 Low-Hanging Fruit (Quick Wins)

These can be implemented quickly with high impact:

1. **Tool Consolidation** - Reduce 23 tools to 6 (see below)
2. **Smart Path Defaults** - Use current directory when path not specified
3. **Enhanced Search Output** - Show line content, context, and highlights
4. **Disable Default Compression** - Already compressed formats don't need zlib
5. **Relative Path Option** - Default to relative paths for readability
6. **File Type Presets** - Smart mappings like `type="code"` with auto-exclusions
7. **Publish as Rust Crate** - Make smart-tree reusable in other Rust projects!

## Immediate Priority: MCP Tool Consolidation

### Consolidate 23 Tools into 6 Core Tools
**Why**: Current 23 tools are overwhelming and approaching MCP limits. Users can't remember them all.

**Proposed Structure**:
1. **`find`** - Universal file finder (replaces 10 find_* tools + search_in_files)
   - `find --type code` (replaces find_code_files)
   - `find --type recent --days 7` (replaces find_recent_changes)
   - `find --content "TODO"` (replaces search_in_files)
   
2. **`analyze`** - Multi-mode analyzer (replaces 5 analyze_* tools)
   - `analyze --mode tree --format quantum` (replaces analyze_directory)
   - `analyze --mode quick` (replaces quick_tree)
   - `analyze --mode project` (replaces project_overview)

3. **`stats`** - Statistics tool (replaces 4 get_* tools)
   - `stats --type general` (replaces get_statistics)
   - `stats --type size` (replaces directory_size_breakdown)
   - `stats --type digest` (replaces get_digest)

4. **`compare`** - Enhanced comparison tool
5. **`batch`** - New tool for batch operations
6. **`info`** - Server information

See [MCP_TOOL_CONSOLIDATION.md](docs/MCP_TOOL_CONSOLIDATION.md) for full details.

### Change Default Compression Setting
**Current**: AI modes default to compressed output
**Proposed**: Default to uncompressed since formats are already highly optimized
**Rationale**: As you noted, the formats are already pretty compressed, and having zlib compression on top makes debugging harder and adds unnecessary complexity.

## Current MCP Tool Improvements

### search_in_files Enhancement (Moving to `find --content`)
Currently shows:
```json
{"file": "grid.rs", "matches": 5}
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "file": "grid.rs",
  "matches": [
    {
      "line": 42,
      "content": "use crate::core::{BindCell, Result};",
      "column": 17,
      "context": {
        "before": "// Import core functionality",
        "after": "use crate::memory::WavePool;"
      }
    },
    {
      "line": 156,
      "content": "    let result = BindCell::new(config)?;",
      "column": 21,
      "highlight": [21, 29]  // Highlight the match
    }
  ],
  "total_matches": 5,
  "shown": 2,  // Limit shown to prevent huge outputs
  "truncated": true
}
```

With the new consolidated `find` tool:
```bash
# Old way
search_in_files --keyword "BindCell" --path src/

# New way - more powerful and flexible
find --path src/ --content "BindCell" --show-context --limit 10
```

### Batch Operations
- `read_files_from_search`: Read all files from search results
- `find_and_replace`: Pattern-based replacement across files
- Parallel search with multiple patterns in one call

### Quality of Life
1. **Better Path Display**
   - Option for relative paths from a base directory
   - Configurable path truncation for long paths

2. **File Type Presets**
   - `--type rust_src`: *.rs excluding tests
   - `--type config`: Cargo.toml, package.json, etc.
   - `--type docs`: *.md, *.txt, README*

3. **Smart Workspace Analysis**
   - Cache results with TTL for large codebases
   - Incremental updates based on file changes
   - Background refresh when idle

## Integration Ideas

### With MEM8 System
- Use smart-tree as the filesystem layer for MEM8
- Export tree data in wave-pattern format
- Enable quantum entanglement between related directories

### With Development Workflow
- Pre-push hooks that update .mem8 metadata
- CI/CD integration for semantic validation
- Auto-documentation from .mem8 hierarchy

## Performance Targets
Based on the MEM8 docs:
- .mem8 parsing: <1ms for typical files
- CRC validation: <0.1ms per directory
- Full tree with .mem8: 100x faster than file scanning
- Compression: 90-97% size reduction vs text formats

## Rust Crate Publishing

### Make Smart-Tree a Reusable Library
**Current**: Smart-tree is a CLI tool only
**Proposed**: Publish as `smart-tree` crate on crates.io

**Benefits**:
- Add directory analysis to any Rust project
- Embed MCP server in other applications  
- Create custom formatters
- Use Scanner for build tools, testing, etc.

**Example Usage**:
```rust
use smart_tree::prelude::*;

// Quick directory analysis
let tree = smart_tree::quick_tree(".", 3)?;

// Custom scanning
let scanner = Scanner::new(config);
let files = scanner.scan("src")?;

// AI-optimized formatting
let output = AiFormatter::new().format(&files)?;
```

## 2025-01-08 Update: MCP Context Optimization Analysis

### Issue: All 22 MCP Tools Loaded into Context Simultaneously

**Finding**: After examining the MCP server implementation, smart-tree loads ALL 22 tool descriptions into Claude's context at once when it starts. This happens in `src/mcp/tools.rs` where `handle_tools_list()` returns a hardcoded array of all 22 tools with their full descriptions and input schemas.

**Impact**: 
- Each tool has lengthy descriptions (200+ characters) plus detailed JSON schemas
- Consumes approximately 15-20KB of context tokens before any actual work begins
- Tools like `find_empty_directories` (rarely used) consume the same context as `analyze_directory` (frequently used)

**Current Implementation**:
```rust
// src/mcp/tools.rs
pub async fn handle_tools_list(_params: Option<Value>, _ctx: Arc<McpContext>) -> Result<Value> {
    let tools = vec![
        ToolDefinition { /* all 22 tools hardcoded */ },
        // ... 21 more tools
    ];
    Ok(json!({ "tools": tools }))
}
```

**Recommendations**:

1. **Immediate Fix: Implement Tool Consolidation Plan**
   - The existing `docs/MCP_TOOL_CONSOLIDATION.md` already proposes reducing 23 tools to 6
   - This would reduce context usage by ~75%
   - The consolidated tools (`find`, `analyze`, `stats`, `compare`, `batch`, `info`) cover all functionality

2. **Alternative: Progressive Tool Loading**
   - Implement tool categorization: Essential (5-6), Common (8-10), Specialized (rest)
   - Initially load only Essential tools
   - Add a `list_more_tools` command to reveal additional categories
   - Example implementation:
   ```rust
   pub async fn handle_tools_list(params: Option<Value>, _ctx: Arc<McpContext>) -> Result<Value> {
       let category = params.and_then(|p| p["category"].as_str()).unwrap_or("essential");
       let tools = match category {
           "essential" => vec![/* 5-6 most used tools */],
           "common" => vec![/* 8-10 commonly used tools */],
           "all" => vec![/* all 22 tools */],
           _ => vec![/* essential only */],
       };
       Ok(json!({ "tools": tools, "category": category }))
   }
   ```

3. **Future Enhancement: Context-Aware Tool Loading**
   - Analyze the user's initial request to determine relevant tools
   - Example: If user mentions "find files", load only find-related tools
   - This would require more complex implementation but maximum efficiency

**Priority**: HIGH - This is a significant context optimization that would benefit all smart-tree MCP users immediately.

## 2025-01-08 Update: Quantum Context Infrastructure Integration

  ```
- **Benefit**: Better architectural insights for reducing coupling

#### 5. Wave Interference Analysis
- **Feature**: Extend semantic analysis with wave interference patterns
- **Use Case**: Understand how code concepts interfere or reinforce
- **Implementation**:
  ```rust
  st --wave-interference          # Show concept interference
  st --wave-depth 5               # Deeper wave analysis levels
  st --resonance-map              # Find reinforcing patterns
  ```
- **Benefit**: Identify conceptual conflicts and synergies

#### 6. Quantum Signature Generation
- **Feature**: Generate unique quantum signatures for directories
- **Use Case**: Fast deduplication and similarity detection
- **Implementation**:
  ```rust
  st --quantum-sig /project       # Generate Blake3 quantum signature
  st --sig-compare dir1 dir2      # Compare quantum signatures
  st --find-similar --sig xyz     # Find dirs with similar signatures
  ```
- **Benefit**: Near-instant duplicate detection across massive codebases

### QCP Assembly Integration

#### 7. QCP Program Execution
- **Feature**: Execute QCP assembly programs on directory data
- **Use Case**: Custom quantum transformations and analysis
- **Example**:
  ```rust
  // deduplicate.qcp
  LOAD C0          ; Load directory structure
  WAVE Q0          ; Create quantum state
  WAVE Q1          ; Second state
  INTERFERE Q0 Q1  ; Find differences
  MEASURE Q0 ACC   ; Extract unique patterns
  COMPRESS         ; Deduplicated result
  HALT
  
  // Run: st --qcp-exec deduplicate.qcp /project
  ```
- **Benefit**: Programmable quantum analysis

#### 8. Consciousness-Aware Compression
- **Feature**: Compression that preserves "consciousness" of code
- **Use Case**: Maintain developer intent through compression
- **Implementation**:
  ```rust
  st --mode conscious             # Consciousness-preserving mode
  st --intent-level deep          # How much intent to preserve
  ```
- **Benefit**: Compression that understands, not just reduces

### Technical Implementation Notes

Based on MEM8 documentation analysis:
- QCP protocol is well-defined and ready for integration
- MEM8 BitStream spec provides clear implementation path
- Emotional/temporal tracking has working examples in 8B-Compress.md
- Binary .mem8 format complements existing functionality perfectly

Priority recommendations:
1. Start with QCP integration (enables many other features)
2. Implement MEM8 BitStream for semantic compression
3. Add quantum signature generation for practical benefits
4. Build consciousness-aware modes for developer experience

These quantum features would position smart-tree as the first truly quantum-aware filesystem tool, bridging traditional directory analysis with next-generation quantum computing concepts.

## 2025-01-10 Update: Ignored Directory Explicit Access Fixed! 🎯

### ✅ COMPLETED: Smart Tree Now Shows Ignored Directories When Explicitly Requested!

**Issue Fixed**: When running `st target` on an ignored directory (like `target` which is in .gitignore), Smart Tree would show nothing. This was confusing because users expected to see the contents when they explicitly asked for a specific directory.

**Solution Implemented**: Modified the `should_ignore` function in scanner.rs to never ignore the root path itself. Now when you explicitly scan an ignored directory, it will show its contents regardless of ignore rules.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Normal scan - target directory is hidden (as expected)
st

# Explicit scan - target directory contents are shown!
st target

# This works for any ignored directory
st node_modules
st .git
st __pycache__
```

This follows the principle of least surprise - if a user explicitly asks to see something, we should show it to them!

## 2025-01-08 Update: Universal Input System Implemented! 🌊

### ✅ COMPLETED: Smart Tree Now Accepts Any Context Source!

**Major Achievement**: Smart Tree has evolved beyond file trees into a universal context visualizer! The new input system allows processing of:

1. **Traditional File Systems** - Still works as before
2. **QCP Quantum Contexts** - Direct integration with https://qcp.q8.is
3. **SSE Event Streams** - Visualize real-time events as trees
4. **OpenAPI Specifications** - Navigate APIs like file systems
5. **MEM8 Consciousness Streams** - Connect to wave-based memory

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Traditional (still works)
st /home/user/project

# QCP Quantum Context
st qcp://quantum_analysis
st --input qcp https://qcp.q8.is/context/project

# Server-Sent Events
st https://api.example.com/events
st --input sse http://localhost:8080/stream

# OpenAPI Specification
st https://api.example.com/swagger.json
st ./api-spec.yaml

# MEM8 Stream
st mem8://consciousness_stream_42
st project.mem8
```

### Implementation Details:

**New Input Adapter System** (`src/inputs/`):
- `InputAdapter` trait for extensibility
- Auto-detection of input types
- Quantum state properties for non-traditional nodes
- Entanglement tracking between context nodes

**Supported Features**:
- ✅ Automatic format detection
- ✅ Quantum state visualization for API endpoints
- ✅ Temporal entanglements for event streams
- ✅ Memory wave navigation for MEM8
- ✅ Unified output through existing formatters

**Future Input Types** (infrastructure ready):
- GraphQL schemas
- WebSocket streams
- gRPC service definitions
- AsyncAPI specifications
- Custom quantum protocols

### What This Means:

Smart Tree is no longer just a file tree viewer - it's become **"The Contextual Tool that always knows the tool you need"**. Whether you're exploring:
- A file system
- An API specification
- A real-time event stream
- A quantum context
- A consciousness memory wave

Smart Tree presents it all in a familiar, navigable tree structure with appropriate semantic understanding.

### Technical Notes:

- The QCP adapter includes a full assembly program for quantum analysis
- SSE adapter creates temporal entanglements between events
- OpenAPI adapter calculates quantum states based on HTTP methods
- MEM8 adapter supports both .mem8 files and live streams
- All adapters convert to FileNode for compatibility with existing formatters

This positions Smart Tree as the first tool to truly understand that "context" goes far beyond traditional file systems. In the franchise wars of directory tools, Smart Tree just became the Taco Bell - the only one equipped to survive! 🌮
